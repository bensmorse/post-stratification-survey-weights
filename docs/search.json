Figure 2 shows the weighted versus unweighted means for four key outcome variables — employed, plans to migrate to the U.S. in the next year, experiencing food insecurity, and trusts the Haitian government. As it turns out, the weighted vs. unweighted means are broadly similar, suggesting that the sources of selection into our sample (summarized in Figure 1, above) are not strong determinants of our outcomes of interest and thus not particularly consequential.
